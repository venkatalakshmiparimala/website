    "text": "I have over seven years of experience in web development and database engineering, and my career has been built on a passion for creating high-quality, efficient solutions in dynamic work environments. I enjoy collaborating with teams and contributing to projects that solve real-world problems, especially in the areas of database design, scalable systems, and cloud-based architecture.\nI have experience in property management software development with Entrata India, where I worked within an Agile Scrum framework. I actively participated in sprint planning, project execution, and project management. I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to deliver solutions that enhanced product performance and met client requirements. From optimizing SQL queries to developing scalable microservices, I consistently focused on improving system efficiency and addressing complex technical challenges.\nOne of the highlights of my experience was developing a microservices-based architecture that improved system scalability by 50%, and reduced deployment time by 30%, utilizing technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes. I was also deeply involved in migrating thousands of client documents from local servers to AWS cloud storage, which resolved critical storage limitations and ensured data security and accessibility.\nI led several database projects under the guidance of a database architect with 21 years of experience, gaining in-depth knowledge in database management and architecture design. Utilizing these skills, I contributed to building database structures for various projects and also served as a virtual database administrator for the product. In this role, I delivered multiple database optimization solutions to enhance product efficiency.\nIn addition to my technical expertise, I have worked on multiple projects in the affordable housing sector. I designed solutions for resident management, rental subsidy calculations, eligibility determination, and rent calculations. My contributions to the development of these systems ensured that they were reliable, secure, and user-friendly. I also worked on encrypting sensitive resident data ensuring full compliance with data protection standards.\n\n\n\n\nMicroservices Architecture Development: Spearheaded a project that improved scalability by 50% and reduced deployment times.\nAWS Cloud Migration: Led the migration of 40% of client documents from on-premises servers to AWS S3, solving critical storage challenges.\nIncome Limits Module Redesign: Redesigned the income limits module using automation with Python and OpenAI, resulting in more efficient data handling and improved eligibility calculations for affordable housing.\nSensitive Data Encryption: Worked on encrypting sensitive resident data across the entire database to ensure compliance with security standards.\nState-wise Certification Documents: Developed more than 56 state-specific certification documents for affordable housing using custom scripts and database integration."
