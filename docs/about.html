<p>I have over seven years of experience in web development and database engineering, and my career has been built on a passion for creating high-quality, efficient solutions in dynamic work environments. I enjoy collaborating with teams and contributing to projects that solve real-world problems, especially in the areas of database design, scalable systems, and cloud-based architecture.</p>
<p>I have experience in property management software development with <strong>Entrata India</strong>, where I worked within an Agile Scrum framework. I actively participated in sprint planning, project execution, and project management. I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to deliver solutions that enhanced product performance and met client requirements. From optimizing SQL queries to developing scalable microservices, I consistently focused on improving system efficiency and addressing complex technical challenges.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of my experience was developing a microservices-based architecture that improved system scalability by 50%, and reduced deployment time by 30%, utilizing technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes. I was also deeply involved in migrating thousands of client documents from local servers to AWS cloud storage, which resolved critical storage limitations and ensured data security and accessibility.</p>
<p>I led several database projects under the guidance of a database architect with 21 years of experience, gaining in-depth knowledge in database management and architecture design. Utilizing these skills, I contributed to building database structures for various projects and also served as a virtual database administrator for the product. In this role, I delivered multiple database optimization solutions to enhance product efficiency.</p>
<p>In addition to my technical expertise, I have worked on multiple projects in the affordable housing sector. I designed solutions for resident management, rental subsidy calculations, eligibility determination, and rent calculations. My contributions to the development of these systems ensured that they were reliable, secure, and user-friendly. I also worked on encrypting sensitive resident data ensuring full compliance with data protection standards.</p>

<h1>Kiran Dabbiril</h1>
<p><strong>Name: Kiran Dabbiril</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gnumber: #G01512356</strong></p>
<p>I am Kiran Dabbiril. I am from Visakhapatnam (City of Destiny), Andhra Pradesh which is located in India. I worked as a Process Analyst with <strong>Deputy Manager</strong> designation in the well esteemed organization <strong>ICICI Bank Pvt. Ltd</strong>. I have experience of more than 3 years in internal audit process. My role was to find the anomalies in the jewel loan product and submit the anomalies to the respective stakeholders by raising the service requests. I was also a part of the in developing a project where the text extracted from food and transport receipts uploaded by the ICICI employees. This has reduced the throughput time for data cleaning for 8 hours and increased the efficiency by reducing the manual efforts. I have knowledge in python, Fraud Analysis, SQL, Jupyter and all the Customer Operations. I also play a major role in reporting all the anomalies and critical findings related substandard activities and recommend the necessary steps for the compliance closure.</p>
<p>I am pursuing my <strong>Master’s in Data Analytics Engineering in George Mason University</strong>, Fairfax located in Virginia state in United States of America. I completed by undergrad in the field of Computer Science in Andhra University which is located in Andhra Pradesh. I scored a GPA of 8.02 with distinction.</p>
<p>During my undergrad I did my project on <strong>Detecting Anomalies Users Behavior On Social Networking</strong>. I was the team lead in my undergrad project. In his project we aimed at understanding the users’ patterns in the dataset that is available at Andhra University for educational purposes. We collected a nearly one million row dataset that contains users’ personas like name, age, gender, along with user actions such as number of clicks, number of messages sent, Posts shared. We then trained a K-means unsupervised model on a sample small data set to detect outliers. From this K-means output, we drafted a labelled dataset with two classes for fraud detection and non-fraud detection and then used Logistic regression modeling to classify the user profile to be anomalous or normal. The experience in ICICI Bank made me so confident in my skills and work. I used to handle a team and conducts internal audits all over the state and find the anomalies and submit the same to the respective stakeholders. During this process I learnt how to handle a team and how to organize the work responsibilities accordingly. During my undergrad, I was the team lead in all the projects, events and many fest fairs organized which made my skills grew and helped me in my work. I I was the class representative and assisted the professors in all the class hold activities. I also attended the seminars on Artificial Intelligence, Web Security, Microsoft Azure where I gained a lot of knowledge in these fields. I did my internship in HEWLETT PACKARD on developing a web application on online shopping using CORE JAVA, JSP where it uses JDBC to interface the database. I also participated in <strong>SMART INDIA HACKTHON</strong> conducted by the <strong>DIGITAL INDIA in 2017</strong> and was nominated in finale.</p>
<p>Currently, I am focusing on upskilling my technologies which helps me to handle data analysts programming and also I have a future goal to become Data Analyst or Data Scientist in one of the reputed companies. I am preparing myself in enhancing my skills in the field of data analytics. I am looking forward to apply my skills in new and challenging environments.</p>
