# Venkata Lakshmi Parimala Pasupuleti  
### Software Engineer | Web & Database Development Specialist

I have over seven years of experience in web development and database engineering, and my career has been built on a passion for creating high-quality, efficient solutions in dynamic work environments. I enjoy collaborating with teams and contributing to projects that solve real-world problems, especially in the areas of database design, scalable systems, and cloud-based architecture.

I have experience in property management software development with **Entrata India**, where I worked within an Agile Scrum framework. I actively participated in sprint planning, project execution, and project management. I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to deliver solutions that enhanced product performance and met client requirements. From optimizing SQL queries to developing scalable microservices, I consistently focused on improving system efficiency and addressing complex technical challenges.

One of the highlights of my experience was developing a microservices-based architecture that improved system scalability by 50%, and reduced deployment time by 30%, utilizing technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes. I was also deeply involved in migrating thousands of client documents from local servers to AWS cloud storage, which resolved critical storage limitations and ensured data security and accessibility.

I led several database projects under the guidance of a database architect with 21 years of experience, gaining in-depth knowledge in database management and architecture design. Utilizing these skills, I contributed to building database structures for various projects and also served as a virtual database administrator for the product. In this role, I delivered multiple database optimization solutions to enhance product efficiency.

In addition to my technical expertise, I have worked on multiple projects in the affordable housing sector. I designed solutions for resident management, rental subsidy calculations, eligibility determination, and rent calculations. My contributions to the development of these systems ensured that they were reliable, secure, and user-friendly. I also worked on encrypting sensitive resident data ensuring full compliance with data protection standards.
